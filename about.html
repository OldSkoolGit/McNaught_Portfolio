					<h5><strong>A little bit about Myself...</strong></h5>
					<p>I am currently a full-time student at North Metropolitan TAFE, Northbridge, studying Web Development.</p>
					<p>After a 23 year career working for the State Government, many of those in the Western Australia Police Force, I decided it was time for a change and resigned in December 2017 to pursue a goal of becoming a Web Developer. I commenced a Certificate IV in Web-Based Technologies in February 2018, with a view to pursuing my goal and securing my future in Web Development. I successfully achieved that qualification so continued my studies through to 2019, where I'm on the road to completing my Diploma of Web Development.</p>
					<p>Previously, I worked in the WA Police Force Metropolitan Improvement Program. I was primarily responsible for overseeing program management, which included implementation of a project governance and reporting process, monitoring and reporting of project performance (schedules, key milestones, deliverables/outputs, risks), managing the program of work documentation (registers, controlled and approved documentation) and working with the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) and Project Director to ensure adequate resourcing to effectively undertake projects.</p>
					<p>Other activities included the ongoing management, monitoring and reporting of project progress through the agency’s SharePoint-based Project Management Workspace (PMW). The role also included identifying risks, assisting in the development of appropriate risk mitigation strategies and creating project Work Breakdown Structures and Gantt charts. I also developed and implemented change and communications strategies, which included stakeholder assessments, change activity action plans and change and communications activities. I was also responsible for implementing the agency’s standardised project templates and developing and maintaining project-specific templates for the Program.</p>
