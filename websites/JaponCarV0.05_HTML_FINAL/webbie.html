				<h2>I wasn't always a Web Developer...</h2>
				<br>
				<p>My name is Nathan McNaught, I am currently a full-time student at North Metropolitan TAFE, Northbridge, studying Web Development.</p>
				<br>
				<p>After a 23 year career working for the State Government, many of those in the Western Australia Police Force, I decided it was time for a change and resigned in December 2017 to pursue a new goal of becoming a Web Developer. I commenced a Certificate IV in February 2017, with a view to pursuing my goal and securing my future as a Web Developer.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Previous roles I have undertaken include working as a Project Officer in the WA Police Force Metropolitan Improvement Program. My key role was to assist in project management activities and the ongoing tracking and reporting of project progress through the agency’s Project Management Workspace (PMW). The role included identifying risks, assisting in the development of appropriate risk mitigation strategies and creation of project Work Breakdown Structures and Gantt charts, which I maintained weekly to ensure current, accurate tracking of the project.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Additionally, I assisted in developing and implementing change and communications activities, including stakeholder assessments, change activity action plans and change and communications activities. I was also responsible for implementing the agency’s standardised project templates and developing and maintaining project-specific templates for the program.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Throughout various stages between August 2014 and December 2016, I acted in the position of Program Manager, Evidence Based Policing Division (EBPD). This position was responsible for overseeing program management for the EBPD, which included implementation of a project governance and reporting process, monitoring and reporting of project performance (schedules, key milestones, deliverables/outputs, risks), managing the program of work documentation (registers, controlled and approved documentation) and working with the SRO and Project Director to ensure adequate resourcing to effectively undertake projects.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I acted in the position of Coordinator, Assurance and Control, Level 6, Management Audit Unit as required between May 2008 and July 2014, when the position was abolished as a result of an agency-wide reform program.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Coordinator, Assurance and Control was responsible for planning and coordinating high level audits of agency systems and processes, using risk based methodologies to provide suitable audit coverage. The position was also responsible for supervising a team of internal auditors, mentoring junior staff and providing a quality assurance role throughout the audit process. Additionally, the position ensured the responsibilities and obligations of the audit function were achieved by maintaining the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The position was instrumental to the operations of the Management Audit Unit and was called upon to assist in agency-wide reviews, as well as provide strategic and policy advice to management on auditing, review and related matters.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I was the Senior Internal Auditor, Level 4, Management Audit Unit from February 2004 to July 2014, when the position was abolished as a result of an agency-wide reform program.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The position involved planning and undertaking internal audits, including system examinations and information systems audits. The position encompassed a number of duties including the collection, analysis and documentation of information to support findings made throughout audits and preparation of comprehensive audit reports for consideration by senior executive management.</p>
