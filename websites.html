					<h5><strong>TAFE Alumni</strong></h5>
					<p>The <i>TAFE Alumni</i> website was created as part of an assessment in my Web Development Diploma course. The Project Team worked with a real-life client to build a website primarily aimed at current and former students of Central and North Metropolitan TAFE. The website enables members to connect and remain in contact with lecturers and other students (current and former) and keep track of where former students are and what they are doing in industry. The website also provdes a facility for those students to share their experiences.<br><strong>Please click on the image to the left to view the website.</strong></p>

					<h5><strong>Motivation Foundation</strong></h5>
					<p>I was part of a Project Team who worked on this website for a real-life client, the Motivation Foundation. They are a not-for-profit organisation whose purpose is the relief of poverty or distress in disadvantaged young people through education and development of life employability skills. The website launched on 31 January 2019 and has received positive feedback from both the client and visitors to the site.<br><strong>Please click on the image to the left to view the website.</strong></p>

The website was developed as part of an assessment for my studies in Web Development and the design was received well by lecturers and fellow students.<br><strong>Please click on the image to the left to view the website.</strong></p>
